# Vas-Batalis
Hello, my name is Vas Batalis, I am a student at Ivy Tech that is pursuing a career in software development. I used to go for cybersecurity, but I have found an interest in the coding aspect of cybersecurity and wanted to focus more on that.

My skills are hardware and software and I have a certification for COMPTIA A+, I know Python pretty well and GDscript.

Me and a buddy of mine made a Python program that has the time, a stopwatch, and a countdown timer (a database was also added to it as well). You can find the project here: https://github.com/CoxAlexander/SDEV_220_Final_Project_AlexVas
